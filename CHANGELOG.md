## [3.0.0] - 2026-03-14

### Changed
- **Complete rewrite** — Deepgram streaming-only architecture (removed local daemon, 5-backend system, BTW side conversations)
- **Separated Pompom companion** — creature animation now ships as its own extension (`@codexstar/pi-pompom`)
- **Renamed package** — `@codexstar/pi-listen` → `@codexstar/pi-voice`

### Added
- **Double-escape editor clear** — press Escape twice within 500ms to clear the editor text
- **Cross-platform escape handling** — filters Kitty key-release/repeat events to prevent false triggers
- **Voice commands** — "hey pi, run tests", "undo", "submit", "new line", punctuation shortcuts
- **Continuous dictation** — `/voice dictate` for long-form input without holding keys
- **Recording history** — `/voice history` shows recent transcriptions
- **Audio-reactive UI** — braille waveform + face widget that reacts to voice levels
- **Enterprise hold detection** — Kitty protocol + non-Kitty gap-based fallback with typing cooldown

### Removed
- Local STT daemon (`daemon.py`, `transcribe.py`)
- 5-backend system (faster-whisper, moonshine, whisper-cpp, parakeet)
- BTW side conversations
- VAD pre-filtering
- Pompom/Lumo creature companion (now separate package)
